# Personal website / resume 
Small project to stretch my non-work dev muscles with some different technologies

## Tech used
 - React + TypeScript + Vite
 - Tailwind CSS 
 - react-i18next 
 - JSON Resume Schema 

## Current state of affairs 
The goal of this project wasn't to support all properties of JSON Resume - so it doesn't.

I might add more later, but since it's for personal use, I just used what I felt like using. For proper themes, check https://jsonresume.org/themes

## TODO 
- âœ… ~~PDF generation~~ 
- ðŸ”³ Theme switching
